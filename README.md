- 👋 Hi, I’m @CraftyBecky - I also go by Becky McDaniel
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more of front-end web development, with some UI/UX design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, but HTML and CSS are still somewhat new, so I will be continuing to learn those. In the future I will move onto React and Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on. I do not have any ideas yet but if you have any ideas feel free to reach out. 
- 📫 How to reach me rebeckah.mcdaniel@gmail.com and CraftyBecky on Discord.
