- 👋 Hi, I’m Becky (Rebeckah) McDaniel
- 👀 I am working hard on learning front end web development, and some UI/UX design. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, but HTML and CSS are still somewhat new, so I will be continuing to learn those. In the future I will move onto Vue, React, and Angular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that will help me build me skills and that I can be of any assistance to.
- 📫 How to reach me rebeckah.mcdaniel@gmail.com and CraftyBecky on Discord.
